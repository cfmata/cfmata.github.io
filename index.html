<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I'm a 3rd year Ph.D. student in the Robotics lab, advised by Michael Ryoo. My research interests lie in computer vision and its applications to content moderation. I’m especially interested in video segmentation and how best to use unlabelled data. Prior to Stony Brook I did my undergrad and M.Eng. at MIT, where I worked at the Infolab on fine parts segmentation and making hand pose estimation algorithms robust to occlusion. I've done internships with the Camera Group at Apple and the autonomous checkout startup Standard Cognition. Currently I’m away on internship at Microsoft. Outside the lab I’ve been an active member of the Computer Science Graduate Student Organization and Graduate Women in Science and Engineering in an effort to foster connections within the graduate student community at Stony Brook.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
