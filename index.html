<p class="p1">I’m a PhD student in the Robotics lab at Stony Brook University, advised by Michael Ryoo. My work focuses on video understanding at the pixel level. I’m especially interested in new ways to use synthetic or unlabelled data to train video models. Prior to Stony Brook I did my undergrad and M.Eng. at MIT, where I worked at the Infolab on fine parts segmentation and making hand pose estimation algorithms robust to occlusion. I've done internships with the Camera Group at Apple, the autonomous checkout startup Standard Cognition and Microsoft. You can contact me at cfmata@cs.stonybrook.edu.</p>
