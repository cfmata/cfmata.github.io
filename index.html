<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I'm a 2nd year Ph.D. student in the Computer Vision lab, advised by Michael Ryoo. My interests lie in computer vision with a focus on video understanding and its applications to content moderation. I’m especially interested in how best to use unlabelled data. Prior to Stony Brook I did my undergrad and M.Eng. at MIT, where I worked at the Infolab on fine parts segmentation and making hand pose estimation algorithms robust to occlusion. I've done internships with the Camera Group at Apple and the autonomous checkout startup Standard Cognition. I'm the President of the Computer Science Graduate Student Organization and Vice President of Graduate Women in Science and Engineering. My goal in both of these roles is to empower women and foster connections within the graduate student community at Stony Brook.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
